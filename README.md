<h2>Hi! This is my first front-end project to practice skills of web design and layouts.</h2>
<br>
I brainstormed an online productivity-tool brand called "set-up", which provides charts and mind maps with diversity to help the users to manage plans and achieve their dream goals! 
<br>
The website is designed to demonstrate the concepts of the brand to its users, which contains the feature introductions, brand story, user experiences, etc.
<br>
Although the contents so far is all fictional, I'm looking forward to make "set-up" a real running app in the future!
