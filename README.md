### **Afterword**

This is my first front-end project to practice skills of web design and layouts.

I brainstormed an online productivity-tool brand called "set-up", which provides charts and mind maps with diversity to help the users to manage plans and achieve their dream goals.

The website is designed to demonstrate the concepts of the brand to its users, which contains the feature introductions, brand story, user experiences, etc.

Although the contents so far is all fictional, I'm looking forward to make "set-up" a real running app in the future!
