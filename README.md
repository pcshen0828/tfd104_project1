Hi! This is my first front-end project to practice skills of web design and layouts.
I brainstormed an online productivity-tool brand called "set-up", and the website is designed to demonstrate the concepts of the brand to its users, which contains the feature introductions, brand story, user experiences, etc.
Although the contents so far is all fictional, I'm looking forward to make "set-up" a real running app in the future!
